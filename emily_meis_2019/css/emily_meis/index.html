      <h2 id="what">What is it?</h2>
      <p>
        Anemia is when you have an abnormally amount
        of red blood cells or hemoglobin. According
        to The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute,
        “hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein that helps
        red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to
        the rest of the body.” This means when you have
        anemia, you cannot get enough oxygen through your
        bloodstream. This can cause several things like
        feeling tired or having low energy and feeling
        cold in the hands or feet. You may experience
        some breathing issues or irregular heartbeats.
        There are various forms of anemia and many ways
        to treat patients with anemia. Anemia can occur
        to anyone and it is very treatable. Most cases
        of anemia can occur in women who may be on their
        menstrual cycle or for people who donate blood
        regularly. </p>

      <h2 id="risk">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>
        Some people may have a higher risk factor than others.
        Many people are anemic because they have a poor diet
        or an underlying medical issue. There are various forms
        of anemia many don’t realize and may include:
        iron-deficiency, vitamin-deficiency, Aplastic anemia,
        hemolytic, sickle cell anemia, and many other forms of
        anemia caused by other diseases. Women are more prone
        to being anemic if they have regular menstrual cycles or
        if they may be pregnant. Chronic conditions including;
        Rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, kidney disease, liver
        disease, and inflammatory bowel disease. Most signs of
        anemia are usually overlooked, and most people don’t
        realize they are anemic until they have a blood test and
        it’s in the results.

      <h2 id="symptoms">Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        Symptoms of anemia are very easy to spot in some cases,
        most of the time they go unnoticed. First, many patients
        who have anemia always mention their hands and feet are
        cold. This is due to poor circulation in the bloodstream.
        People who take blood regulation medicines or who
        frequently go to the hospital for cancer care are often
        anemic as well. Anemia can also be an underlying
        condition for something worse and patients should
        always contact their care provider for more information.
      </p>

    <div class="part4">
      <h2 id="treatments">Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        Before treatment, it must be determined what type of anemia
        it is specifically. Each type of anemia is treated differently.
        Iron-deficiency is usually related to blood loss, so your care
        provider may try to determine what is the cause of that. After
        looking through what the cause may be they will either tell
        you to change your diet or take vitamin supplements. That may
        not always be the case, however. If it’s a type of anemia
        dealing with chronic diseases, like aplastic anemia that
        directly effects your bone marrow, then the treatments
        would vary. Most treatments for that include blood transfusions
        or prescribed medication. Just to be safe, always contact
        a care provider of treatment options.
      </p>

      <h2 id="prevention">Prevention</h2>
      <p>
        Many types of anemia cannot be prevented. Most can be prevented
        by eating a well-balanced meal, exercising often, and generally
        just making the right choices. Include foods that may be high in
        iron like beef, leafy vegetables, or nuts. Supplements and multivitamins
        also help to avoid having to deal with anemia unless your care provider
        specifically instructs you not to do that. It’s important to always be
        aware of the symptoms because anyone could be anemic. If you are not
        sure of you are, but display some symptoms related to anemia, please
        contact your service care provider because it may be an underlying
        condition.
